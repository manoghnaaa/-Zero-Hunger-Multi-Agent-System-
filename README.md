# -Zero-Hunger-Multi-Agent-System-
Hello peers! New Achievement Unlocked 🚀 "Zero Hunger Multi-Agent System" A collaborative project aimed at tackling food insecurity using a multi-agent system. This system leverages autonomous agents to optimize food distribution, reduce waste, and improve access to nutrition.

Using Hugging Face Token Great! I accessed your Colab project titled "Zero Hunger MAS" through the provided link.

Based on your project’s structure, here is a professional and detailed README.md file that you can include in your repository or documentation.

📘 README – Zero Hunger Multi-Agent System (MAS)
🧠 Project Title:
AI-Powered Multi-Agent System for Achieving Zero Hunger

📌 Overview
The Zero Hunger MAS project is an AI-driven simulation platform that models real-world food systems using multiple intelligent agents. It uses natural language processing (NLP) via Hugging Face to guide decision-making in areas like farming, nutrition, food distribution, and emergency response — all aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: Zero Hunger.

This project is built and tested entirely in Google Colab, offering an accessible, modular, and impactful way to simulate solutions for food insecurity and distribution inefficiencies.

🚀 Features
🧑‍🌾 FarmerAgent: Decides which crops to plant based on soil, water, and AI advice.
🛒 ConsumerAgent: Requests healthy meal suggestions based on available ingredients.
🚚 DistributorAgent: Suggests food transport solutions in times of surplus or shortage.
🍎 NutritionExpertAgent: Provides personalized dietary advice using AI.
🌦️ EnvironmentAgent: Simulates environmental conditions (optional).
🤖 Hugging Face NLP: Agents query a powerful language model (e.g., FLAN-T5) using a secure API token.
🧩 Gradio & Widgets UI: Interact with the MAS using a simple prompt UI (optional).
📄 JSON Logs: Logs of agent queries and AI responses for future analysis.
🧑‍💻 Tech Stack
| Technology | Purpose

| Python | Core programming language
| Google Colab | Development and execution platform
| Hugging Face Inference API | AI-powered language understanding
| ipywidgets / Gradio | User Interface for input-output interaction
| JSON | Logging and storage format for agent decisions

📦 Installation & Setup
Open in Colab: 🔗 Click here to open the notebook

Enter your Hugging Face Token: You must create a Hugging Face account and generate a token from your settings. Insert it in the notebook where prompted:

HF_TOKEN = "your_huggingface_token_here"
Run Each Cell: Follow the notebook from top to bottom. The agents are initialized, followed by interactions, Gradio/Widget UIs, and response logs.

🧪 Example Usage
prompt = "Floods destroyed rural food storage. Suggest emergency food strategies."
print(query_huggingface(prompt))
Or via Gradio/Widget UI:

Select “Disaster Response”
Click “Ask”
View AI-generated recommendation
📈 Use Cases
Teaching AI and sustainability to students
Prototyping zero-hunger policies
NGO simulation training
Academic research on MAS systems
📌 Future Improvements
🌐 Integrate real-time weather and soil APIs
🧠 Add memory (state retention across agents)
📊 Visualize agent interactions (graph/network view)
📱 Package as mobile/web app for NGOs and farmers

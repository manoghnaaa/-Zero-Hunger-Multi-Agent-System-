# -Zero-Hunger-Multi-Agent-System-
Hello peers! New Achievement Unlocked 🚀 "Zero Hunger Multi-Agent System" A collaborative project aimed at tackling food insecurity using a multi-agent system. This system leverages autonomous agents to optimize food distribution, reduce waste, and improve access to nutrition.
📊 Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Zero_Hunger_multiagentsystem_MAS.ipynb


Run the cells step by step:

Define the environment

Initialize agents

Run the simulation

Visualize results

Modify parameters in the notebook to test different strategies (e.g., number of farmers, distribution efficiency, NGO support, etc.).

📚 Dependencies

Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook

Mesa (for agent-based modeling, if used)

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Pandas / Numpy

(Check your notebook for exact library imports and update requirements.txt accordingly.)

🏆 Applications

Studying sustainable agriculture policies

Testing food distribution efficiency

Educational tool for SDG awareness

Research in agent-based modeling and simulations

📌 Future Work

Expand agent roles (retailers, logistic providers, policy makers)

Add reinforcement learning for adaptive decision making

Scale simulation to larger datasets
